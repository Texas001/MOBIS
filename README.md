Additional packages ：No additional packages
## File：
## Source code file
The code file contains the code used in the paper to simulate the risk of virus transmission in college canteen and the data set used for the experiment.
## Input file
File1 <Input data>: Input data is used to build indoor public place simulation scenarios.
File2 <Infector>: Infector file is to control the number of patients entered and the time of entry.
## Output file
File <Result path>: The resulting data include the spatiotemporal paths of all individuals.
## Windows forms parameters
1. Number of cycles：The number of cycles is used to control the duration of the model run.
2. Infection parameters: Infection parameters are used to adjust the infection risk intensity of the virus and the desired risk threshold.
3. Stage parameters: The stage parameter is used to reflect the moment of change in the intensity of the incoming human traffic in the indoor space.
