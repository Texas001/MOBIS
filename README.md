# MOBIS
# Code File：
The code file contains the code used in the paper to simulate the risk of virus transmission in college canteen and the data set used for the experiment.
# Program input and output： 
1. Number of cycles：The number of cycles is used to control the duration of the model run.
2. Infection parameters: Infection parameters are used to adjust the infection risk intensity of the virus and the desired risk threshold.
3. Stage parameters: The stage parameter is used to reflect the moment of change in the intensity of the incoming human traffic in the indoor space.
4. Input data: Input data is used to build indoor public place simulation scenarios.
5. Result path: The resulting data include the spatiotemporal paths of all individuals.
6. Infector: Infector parameters to control the number of patients entered and the time of entry.
