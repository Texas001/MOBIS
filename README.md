## File：
### Source code file
The code file contains the source code used in the paper to simulate the risk of virus transmission in college canteen .
### Input file
File1 <Input data>: Input data is used to build indoor public place simulation scenarios.
File2 <Infector>: Infector file is to control the number of patients entered and the time of entry.
### Output file
File <Result path>: The resulting data include the spatiotemporal paths of all individuals.
## Windows forms parameters：
### Number of cycles：
The number of cycles is used to control the duration of the model run.
### Infection parameters: 
Infection parameters are used to adjust the infection risk intensity of the virus and the desired risk threshold.
### Stage parameters: 
The stage parameter is used to reflect the moment of change in the intensity of the incoming human traffic in the indoor space.
